Review fixes for the v6 action layer: `buildDeployRevnetTx` no longer attaches the creation fee when initializing an EXISTING project as a revnet (the deployer reverts on any value in that case; `creationFee` is now optional and only required for new revnets). `fillSplitPercents` throws when input drift exceeds rounding error instead of silently rewriting un-normalized groups. The package's `require` conditions now serve real CommonJS output (previously ESM was emitted into `dist/cjs`, breaking `require()` consumers). Docs: USDC-accounting caveat on `getCashOutQuote`, README example fix.
