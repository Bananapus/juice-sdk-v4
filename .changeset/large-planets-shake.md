Add Juicebox V6 support.

- `JBVersion` is now `4 | 5 | 6`; `jbContractAddress` has a `6` key and `/v6:` URNs parse.
- BREAKING: unsuffixed ABI exports (`jbControllerAbi`, `revDeployerAbi`, etc.) are now the V6 ABIs. Older-version ABIs that drifted are exported with a version suffix (e.g. `jbControllerV5Abi`, `revLoansV4Abi`) — use those when reading v4/v5 contracts where the interface changed.
- BREAKING: `CCIP_SUCKER_DEPLOYER_ADDRESSES` is now keyed by version (`5` and `6`) before the chain pair; `parseSuckerDeployerConfig` takes an optional `version` in `opts` (defaults to 5, which also serves v4).
- New V6 contracts: `JBRouterTerminal` and `JBRouterTerminalRegistry` (the swap terminal is replaced by the router terminal in V6). The V6 `ERC2771Forwarder` address is injected at codegen (same address on every chain).
- `useNativeTokenSurplus`, `useSuckersNativeTokenSurplus`, and `useResolveDataHook` branch per version where V6 renamed functions (`currentSurplusOf` takes token addresses; the omnichain deployer's `dataHookOf` split into `tiered721HookOf`/`extraDataHookOf`).
